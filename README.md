# GriZzzly BadSiteList

[GriZzzly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ddagppndhjlaaafikdebjdcdifcaalfo) is a project that aims to block as many public domain blacklists (downloads, drugs, malware, spyware, exploit, phishing, etc.). To do this, I perform a debugging of urls, to avoid duplicates, invalid domains, and filter with white lists of domains (false positives such as google, yandex, yahoo, apple, etc.).
